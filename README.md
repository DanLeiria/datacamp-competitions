### 1) The Bald Truth: A Data-Driven Guide and Classifier to Hair Loss

**Name:** ml-predictor-for-hair-loss

**Executive summary:**
This study analyzed survey data from 999 individuals to investigate the factors influencing hair loss. Variables such as genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors were examined. The analysis was conducted across three levels: descriptive statistics, visualization, and machine learning.

Key findings revealed that no single factor strongly predicts hair loss, highlighting the need for multi-factorial approaches. Age, genetics, and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, poor hair care habits) emerged as the most significant predictors, while medical history and nutritional deficiencies showed limited impact. Among the machine learning models tested, XGBoost achieved the best performance, though classification accuracy ranged between 45% and 65% due to overlapping predictor characteristics.

To improve accuracy, future work should explore advanced modeling techniques like Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and adopt robust validation methods such as nested cross-validation. Enhancing dataset quality by balancing age group representation, incorporating gender as a predictor, and maybe expanding feature sets will also be critical.

This project underscores that while genetics play a role in hair loss, lifestyle improvements and better hair care routines can significantly reduce risk. This conclusion provides a foundation for refining predictive models and advancing our understanding of hair loss prevention.
